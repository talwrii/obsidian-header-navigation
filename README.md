# Obsidian header navigation plugin

This plugin lets you quickly navigate between headers and fold them.
It provides a command to toggle folding of a header.

# Installation
This plugin should be available through obsidian community plugins.

Alternatively you can install it directly by

1. Cloning the git repository into `.obsidian/plugins` in your vault
1. Running `npm install`, `npm run dev` in the repository
1. Reloading obsidian
1. Enabling the plugin in the community plugins tab of settings.

# Using
Press C-P to open the command palette and search for "header nagivation".
This will show the commands that this plugin provides.

I would suggest binding these commands to hotkeys. You might find a plugin like [sequence hotkeys](https://github.com/moolmanruan/obsidian-sequence-hotkeys) useful, this allows you to define a "prefix" key such as C-m for motion commands so you can then assing C-m Up etc for moving around headers.
